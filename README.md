# Riverside Rocks
New website for Riverside Rocks.

Going to be 100% honest here, building a brand new website can suck. But hey, its worth it.

## Requirements

- PHP 7 or higher
- Apache2 (Nginx *should* work, but I've never tried it myself.)

## Installing

Begin by cloning the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/RiversideRocks/web-riverside.git`

Install all dependencies:

`composer install`

You are ready to go!
